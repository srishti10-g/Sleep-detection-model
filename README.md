#  Real-Time Sleeping Detection System  

## Introduction
Fatigue and drowsiness are common causes of accidents and performance issues, especially in sectors like **transportation, security, and workplace safety**.  
**Watchman AI** is a deep learningâ€“based system designed to **detect whether a person is sleeping or awake in real time** using a webcam.  

The system uses:
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
- **OpenCV** for real-time webcam detection.  
- **Data preprocessing & augmentation** to improve model accuracy.

## Features
- Automated **sleeping vs. awake detection** from images and video.  
- **Real-time monitoring** via webcam with on-screen labels.  
- **Audible alarm beep** if the person is detected as sleeping.  
- Easy to train with your own dataset.  
- Modular structure for scalability.
